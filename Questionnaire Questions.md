# Android Upgrade Series Questionnaire Investigation

**Background:** Mobile vendors develop their customized Android versionsbased on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) led byGoogle. As the AOSP releases new versions frequently, vendors need to periodically carry out the Android upgrade. Both the AOSP and Android variants independently undergo extensive and complex modifications. Consequently, Android upgrades often lead to compatibility issues and conflicts. To systematically define, study, and resolve these conflicts during the Android upgrade process, we kindly request you to dedicate 15 minutes to complete the following survey. Your participation will greatly assist us in gathering insights. This survey will be anonymized, focusing solely on trends and improvement suggestions.

9. How do you handle conflict code that repeatedly appears in multiple versions? [Multiple-answer Question]

   - No repeated conflicts found  
   - Directly refer to previous merging methods

    - Never  
    - Occasionally  
    - Frequently

15. What technical challenges do you usually encounter when resolving merge conflicts? [Open-ended Question]

    - Method block conflicts
    - Class member variable conflicts
    - Import conflicts
    - Interface parameter conflicts
    - Scope changes of method blocks or class member variables (e.g., public to private)
    - Changes in inherited native methods
    - Final modifier restrictions
    - Annotation changes
    - Inner class modifications
    - AOSP code updates
    - Renaming conflicts
    - Comment conflicts
    - Interface changes
    - Indirect conflicts

17. Resolving conflicts requires understanding Google's historical solutions. Please assess your familiarity with these solutions on a scale of 1-10. (1 - Least familiar, each solution needs to be understood from the basic architectural principles; 6 - Need to individually review commits and understand historical solutions; 10 - Very familiar, no need to review commits, and already know the solution) [Single-select Question]

    

18. Resolving conflicts requires understanding self-developed project historical solutions. Please assess your familiarity with these solutions on a scale of 1-10. (1 - Least familiar, each solution needs to be understood from the basic architectural principles; 6 - Need to individually review commits and understand historical solutions; 10 - Very familiar, no need to review commits, and already know the solution) [Single-select Question]

    

19. Resolving conflicts requires understanding Google's new upgrade solutions. Please assess your familiarity with these solutions on a scale of 1-10. (1 - Least familiar, each solution needs to be understood from the basic architectural principles; 6 - Need to individually review commits and understand historical solutions; 10 - Very familiar, thorough initial commit analysis, can quickly recall issues) [Single-select Question]

    

20. Would you be willing to accept a follow-up interview? (We can discuss the evolution of upgrades together, making future upgrades smoother) [Single-select Question]

    

21. What tools or resources do you typically use when handling conflicts? [Open-ended Question]

    

22. Have these tools effectively helped you reduce conflict resolution time or improve efficiency? [Open-ended Question]
